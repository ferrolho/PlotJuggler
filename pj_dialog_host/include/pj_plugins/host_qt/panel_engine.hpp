///   * Returns a bare QWidget* via openPanel() instead of running QDialog::exec().
///   * No required QDialogButtonBox — the plugin draws its own button row.
///   * Close is plugin-initiated via WidgetData::requestClose("<reason>");
///     the engine forwards the reason via the callback set with
///     onCloseRequested() and then tears down the panel.
///   * While the panel root is hidden (e.g. pinned into a non-current
///     central tab) ticks are throttled to 1/10 rate — the plugin's periodic
///     logic keeps advancing, the UI poll+diff mostly pauses — and a
///     catch-up tick fires the moment the root is shown again.
///
/// Typical usage from pj_app:
///   auto* engine = new PJ::PanelEngine(std::move(dialog_handle), {}, this);
///   engine->onCloseRequested([this](std::string reason) { restoreCentralArea(); });
///   QWidget* widget = engine->openPanel();
///   if (widget == nullptr) { ... handle error ... }
///   mainWindow->presentPanel(widget);  // takes ownership; engine keeps a weak ref
