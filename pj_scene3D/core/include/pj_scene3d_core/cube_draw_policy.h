// How to draw a cloud of axis-aligned cubes this frame.
//
// Two passes render such a cloud — the point cloud (instance data from a VBO) and the
// voxel grid (derived from gl_InstanceID plus a 3D texture) — and that difference is the
// ONLY thing separating them. Which geometry to use, and whether to draw at all, is the
// same question for both, so it is answered here once instead of twice.
//
// Qt-free and GL-free on purpose: this is the part worth unit-testing exhaustively, and
// it should not need a context to do it.
enum class CubeDrawMode {
  kSkip,    // nothing in the cloud can reach the screen
  kSprite,  // every cube is sub-pixel: one matched point sprite each
  kFan,     // the 3 camera-facing faces, 7 attributeless vertices
  kSolid,   // the full 24-vertex cube — needed when the camera can be inside one
};

// What the calling pass is actually able to draw. chooseCubeDrawMode() picks the ideal
// mode and then degrades to the best available, so a pass that has not implemented a
// geometry yet still gets every decision that does not depend on it.
struct CubeDrawCapabilities {
  bool sprite{false};
  bool fan{false};
  bool solid{false};
};

// Everything the decision depends on, in the cloud's OWN frame.

  // Bounds of the instance CENTRES — what a bounds scan or a lattice extent reports.
  // chooseCubeDrawMode inflates it by half a cube itself; do not pre-inflate.

  glm::mat4 clip_from_cloud{1.0f};  // proj * view * model
  // Camera position in the same frame as centre_bounds. EMPTY under an orthographic
  // camera, which has no eye position — and needs none: there the fan picks its faces
  // from the view DIRECTION, which is the same for every cube however the volume is
  // placed, so the camera-inside case simply cannot arise.
  std::optional<glm::vec3> eye_in_cloud;
  float cube_size_m{0.0f};  // side length (sphere DIAMETER for the sprite shapes)

};

// The whole decision, in the order the cases actually nest.
//
// The inflation in step 1 is not cosmetic: a bounds scan reports where cube CENTRES are,
// but a cube reaches half its side past each one, so testing the raw box culls clouds
// whose geometry still pokes into view — invisible at a 1 cm cube, half a metre of missing
// data at a 1 m one.
//
// Step 3 is what lets a voxel grid use the fan at all. The fan picks its three faces by
// comparing the camera against the cube's CENTRE, which is only right while the camera is
// outside the cube; a voxel is easily large enough to swallow the viewpoint, which is why
// that pass used to be pinned to the solid unconditionally. Asking the question per frame
// instead means it gets the cheap geometry in the overwhelmingly common case and the
// correct geometry in the rare one. The point cloud gains the same protection, which it
// previously lacked entirely.
