// Asynchronous byte fetcher with a hard size cap and bounded redirects.
//
// Contract (all of it load-bearing):
//  - GUI-thread only: construct, fetch(), and destroy on the thread whose event
//    loop delivers the callbacks.
//  - The callback is ALWAYS delivered asynchronously through the event loop —
//    even for local files and immediate errors (deferred via a queued
//    single-shot) — so a caller never re-enters its own stack from fetch().
//  - Local sources (file:// URLs and scheme-less bare paths) are read with
//    QFile inside the fetcher; only http/https ever reach the network; any
//    other scheme fails with "unsupported URL scheme". WASM checks the MEMFS
//    file size against kMaxFetchBytes before allocating its QByteArray; native
//    local-file behavior remains unchanged.
//  - Network requests use QNetworkRequest::setTransferTimeout (15 s) and
//    NoLessSafeRedirectPolicy capped at 4 redirects — bounded, with no
//    https->http downgrade. There is no host allowlist; the egress bound is the
//    scheme/redirect/size/timeout envelope itself, which a redirect cannot
//    escalate beyond. (WHETHER a data-supplied URL is fetched at all is the
//    caller's policy decision — see SceneEntitiesLayer's remote-fetch gate.)
//  - Native http(s) GETs are disk-cached (QNetworkDiskCache, set up in the constructor):
//    a fresh entry is served without the network, and a previously-fetched entry
//    is served from cache when the origin is unreachable, so a model fetched in a
//    prior session still renders offline. Local-file reads bypass the cache. The
//    cache directory is <AppData>/models, overridable via the PJ_MODEL_CACHE_DIR
//    environment variable. In WASM, the browser owns HTTP caching and enforces
//    CORS; the Qt disk-cache backend is deliberately absent.
//  - The response is aborted once it exceeds kMaxFetchBytes — checked against
//    the declared Content-Length as soon as the headers arrive, and against
//    the buffered byte count as the body streams in. An aborted (capped) response
//    is not committed to the cache (a later fetch re-hits the network).
//  - Destroying the fetcher aborts every in-flight request and drops its
//    callback: a callback can never fire after the fetcher is gone. Layers
//    rely on this — each owns its fetcher, so layer destruction cancels the
//    fetch; any extra QPointer guard in a callback is insurance only.
