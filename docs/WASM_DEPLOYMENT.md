# PlotJuggler 4 WebAssembly deployment

PlotJuggler's browser build is a static, threaded Qt/WebAssembly application.
It must be served over HTTPS (or localhost during development) with
cross-origin isolation enabled. Opening `index.html` directly from disk or
using an ordinary `python -m http.server` is not a supported threaded setup.

Qt's deployment guidance describes the generated HTML, JavaScript loader, and
Wasm module, recommends gzip or Brotli compression, and documents the headers
needed by a multithreaded build:
[Qt for WebAssembly](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/wasm.html). Emscripten separately
requires `application/wasm` for streaming compilation and COOP/COEP for
Pthreads:
[WebAssembly server setup](https://emscripten.org/docs/compiling/WebAssembly.html#web-server-setup),
[Pthreads support](https://emscripten.org/docs/porting/pthreads.html).

## Build and package

The exact release toolchain is pinned in `versions.env`. A local equivalent of
the release workflow is:

```bash
source /path/to/emsdk/emsdk_env.sh
cmake -S . -B build-wasm -G Ninja \
  -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/path/to/Qt/6.11.0/wasm_multithread/lib/cmake/Qt6/qt.toolchain.cmake \
  -DQT_HOST_PATH=/path/to/Qt/6.11.0/gcc_64 \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DPJ_BUILD_TESTS=OFF -DPJ_BUILD_DEMOS=OFF \
  -DPJ_WASM_WITH_SCENE2D=ON -DPJ_WASM_WITH_SCENE3D=OFF
cmake --build build-wasm --target pj_app --parallel 4

node scripts/package_wasm.mjs \
  --source build-wasm/pj_app \
  --output build-wasm/deploy
```

The packaging command refuses missing, invalid, or single-threaded build
outputs. To prevent a mistyped `--output` from deleting unrelated data, it
only replaces an absent directory, an empty directory, or a prior package with
a valid PlotJuggler deployment manifest. It emits a stable entrypoint and
content-addressed assets:

```text
build-wasm/deploy/
├── index.html
├── manifest.json
├── _headers
└── assets/sha256-<bundle-id>/
    ├── plotjuggler4.js[.br|.gz]
    ├── plotjuggler4.wasm[.br|.gz]
    ├── qtloader.js[.br|.gz]
    └── qtlogo.svg[.br|.gz]
```

`manifest.json` records every identity/Brotli/gzip path, byte size, SHA-256,
MIME type, cache class, and compression runtime/parameters. Gzip metadata is
normalized, Brotli uses a fixed quality/window, and release CI pins Node, so
identical inputs produce byte-identical packages. The generated `_headers`
file's path, size, and hash are covered separately as deployment configuration;
the file configures isolation and cache policy on hosts that
support the Netlify/Cloudflare Pages format; it does not make a host select
precompressed variants automatically.

## Required HTTP contract

Every response, including the entrypoint and runtime assets, needs:

| Header | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` | `same-origin` |
| `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy` | `require-corp` |
| `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy` | `same-origin` |
| `X-Content-Type-Options` | `nosniff` |

Serve the logical asset URL using content negotiation:

- prefer its `.br` sibling when `Accept-Encoding` allows `br` and return
  `Content-Encoding: br`;
- otherwise use `.gz` with `Content-Encoding: gzip`, or the identity file;
- always keep the logical resource's MIME type—especially
  `Content-Type: application/wasm` for `plotjuggler4.wasm`; and
- return `Vary: Accept-Encoding` for resources with encoded variants.

The stable `index.html` and `manifest.json` use `Cache-Control: no-cache` so a
client revalidates for a new bundle. Files below `assets/sha256-<bundle-id>/`
use `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`; their URL changes when
any runtime asset changes. A host may ignore the precompressed siblings and use
equivalent dynamic compression, provided the same MIME, isolation, and cache
contract is preserved.

Cross-origin data loaded by the application has its own CORS/CORP requirements.
Do not weaken the application asset policy globally to work around an unrelated
remote server; configure that data origin explicitly.

## Browser-local state

Uploaded files are staged in the page's temporary filesystem and receive opaque
browser identities; they are not persisted across refreshes. Ordinary
`QSettings` callers are likewise redirected to page-lifetime storage. The only
durable browser state is the typed preference allowlist and a bounded list of
source-free generic layout recipes owned by `BrowserPersistence`. Source-bound
layouts are downloaded with logical references and require explicit file
reselection when replayed. Paths, upload identities, plugin configuration, and
credentials are intentionally excluded from browser-local persistence.

## Local serving and release verification

The repository includes a manifest-driven reference server for local testing:

```bash
node scripts/serve_wasm.mjs --root build-wasm/deploy --port 6931
```

It binds to `127.0.0.1` by default, performs real Brotli/gzip negotiation, sends
the production header/cache contract, and rejects files not declared by the
manifest. It is a correctness reference and development server, not a managed
TLS or high-availability production service.

The deployment acceptance test verifies raw encoded response hashes, MIME,
cache/isolation headers, conditional requests, and a fresh threaded Chromium
boot from the packaged root:

```bash
cd tests/wasm
npm ci
npx playwright install chromium
PJ_WASM_PACKAGE_DIR="$PWD/../../build-wasm/deploy" npm run test:deployment
```

## Release size report and budgets

The complete Release product is gated in all published representations. After
creating the deterministic archive, reproduce the CI check with:

```bash
source ./versions.env
node scripts/check_wasm_size.mjs \
  --package build-wasm/deploy \
  --archive "build-wasm/PlotJuggler-${PJ_APP_VERSION}-wasm.tar.gz" \
  --output build-wasm/wasm-size-report.json
npm --prefix tests/wasm run test:size
```

The checker first verifies every packaged representation against the manifest,
then enforces the identity, Brotli, gzip, and aggregate archive limits from
`tests/wasm/size_budget.json`. A value exactly at its limit passes; one byte
over fails. Its deterministic JSON also records total served assets, hashes,
headroom/rationale, one-feature-off delivered-size measurements, and the
largest retained Qt/application/third-party inputs. The measurement method,
Release-versus-debug finding, and reproducible contributor audit ship with the
wasm release-automation change (`docs/research/wasm_binary_size_audit.md`).

`.github/workflows/wasm-ci.yml` is a manual (`workflow_dispatch`) check for the
wasm platform — run it on demand from the Actions tab (or `gh workflow run
"WASM CI" --ref <branch>`) when working on a wasm-relevant change or before
merging one, since the wasm build is expensive and most PRs don't touch it. It
builds the production configuration, packages it twice and diffs the outputs,
runs this browser gate against the package, then builds the probe configuration
and runs the functional browser suite. The complete release workflow
(deterministic archive, size budget, tag publishing) ships with the wasm
release-automation change.

All of this tooling is outside the native build graph. `PJ_QT_VERSION` and the
existing desktop configure/install behavior are unchanged; the additional
Qt/WASM, Emscripten, and packaging-Node pins are consumed only by the
WebAssembly workflows.
