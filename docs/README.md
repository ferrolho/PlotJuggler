# PJ4 top-level `docs/`

This folder is for **cross-cutting documentation only** — material that doesn't fit inside any single module's `docs/` folder.

> **Qt toolchain:** PJ4 builds against the Qt version pinned in
> [`../versions.env`](../versions.env) (currently **Qt 6.11.1**). Install it with
> the repo-root [`../install_qt6.sh`](../install_qt6.sh). See
> [`QT_NOTES.md`](./QT_NOTES.md) for what changed since 6.8.

Examples of what belongs here:

- Porting strategy / migration notes that span multiple modules.
- Glossary or terminology references used across the repo.
- Architecture decision records (ADRs) for choices that affect multiple modules.
- **Research notes** that informed multiple modules' designs — under `research/`.
- Work-in-progress design specs for modules that don't yet have their own `docs/`.

## What does NOT belong here

- **Module-local intent docs** (REQUIREMENTS, ARCHITECTURE, USER_MANUAL, …) — those live in `<module>/docs/`.
  Examples in this repo: `pj_scene2D/docs/`, `pj_marketplace/docs/`.
- **Plan documents that are repo-wide** — `PJ4_PLAN.md` lives at the repo root.
- **Agent-management state** (`.remember/`, `.claude/`, `.agents/`) — those are not human-readable docs.

## Current contents

| Path | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `QT_NOTES.md` | Reference | **Qt 6.11.1 baseline.** Features new since 6.8 (likely past most models' training cutoff), deprecations, and build/platform floors. Read before using an unfamiliar Qt API or reaching for a 6.8-era workaround. |
| `TELEMETRY.md` | Reference | The anonymous launch ping: exact field list (the privacy contract, enforced by `telemetry_ping_test`), opt-out, and where it's implemented. Update together with any payload change. |
| `undo_redo_integrity_plan.md` | Plan (delivered) | Consolidated undo/redo state-integrity delivery plan: dataset identity, transactional undo, timeline-state snapshots, processor/scene persistence — five incremental PRs (#373 #377 #379 #380 #382, all merged) distilled from two prior solution branches. |
| `was_pending_followup_plan.md` | Plan (draft) | Follow-up to the state-integrity epic: unified was-pending semantics for scene restore queues — serialize binding state instead of origin so exact-restore correctness is structural rather than shell-maintained. |
| `research/dataset_format_comparison.md` | Reference | Cross-cutting comparison of MCAP, RLDS, LeRobot, Zarr. Informs pj_scene2D and any future dataset-format work. |
| `research/rerun_notes.md` | Reference | Analysis of Rerun's 2D architecture; comparison input for pj_scene2D and (potentially) pj_scene3D. |

## Where to find module docs

See the "Module documentation index" in the top-level [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md). Each PJ4 module owns a `CLAUDE.md` at its root and, when warranted, a `docs/` folder with `REQUIREMENTS.md` / `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
