# pj_scene2D Technical Notes

Implementation-relevant technical knowledge for the pj_scene2D module — a
supplementary knowledge base sitting alongside `ARCHITECTURE.md`. Where
`ARCHITECTURE.md` defines HOW the module is built today, this file captures the
**domain background** that informed those decisions: Qt 6.8 specifics, codec
caveats, platform HW-accel matrices, debugging notes, and lessons brought over
from the standalone experiment.

Read `ARCHITECTURE.md` first for the module's current shape; come here for
"why this Qt API and not that one" or "what we learned from prior attempts."

Sources: the standalone pj_scene2D experiment, the video_player_lab
prototype (both working trees since removed; their lessons are captured
here and in `ARCHITECTURE.md`), and design discussions for the
integrated module.

## 1. Qt 6.8 Video Rendering

### QMediaPlayer Limitations

QMediaPlayer is unsuitable for PlotJuggler's needs:

| Limitation | Detail |
|---|---|
| No frame-accurate seeking | Lands on nearest keyframe only |
| No frame stepping | No `stepForward()`/`stepBackward()` API |
| No low-latency streaming | RTSP has 2-3s latency; no native SRT |
| No external clock sync | Cannot tie playback to an external timeline |

A custom decode pipeline is required.

### QAbstractVideoBuffer (Public Again in 6.8)

Qt 6.8 made `QAbstractVideoBuffer` public (it was private in 6.0-6.7). This is
the bridge between a custom decode pipeline and Qt's rendering:

- Three virtuals: `format()`, `map()`, `unmap()`
- `QVideoFrame(std::unique_ptr<QAbstractVideoBuffer>)` takes ownership
- CPU-accessible buffers only via the public API
- True GPU texture passthrough requires `QHwVideoBuffer` (private/internal)

### QRhiWidget — Primary Render Path

`QRhiWidget` with custom shaders is the primary render path:

- QRhi abstracts over Vulkan, Metal, D3D11, OpenGL
- **YUV420P texture support**: 3 R8 textures (Y full-res, U half-res, V half-res)
  uploaded per frame. 75% less GPU memory than a single RGBA8 texture
  (1.5 bytes/pixel vs 4 bytes/pixel). YUV->RGB conversion in the fragment shader.
- **NV12 texture support** (hardware-decode download format): Y as an R8 texture +
  interleaved UV as an **RG8** texture (two-plane), avoiding the per-frame
  `sws_scale` repack to YUV420P. `isUploadablePixelFormat(kNV12)` is gated on the
  backend; `nv12ToYuv420p` (decoded_frame.h) is the CPU fallback for backends
  without RG8 and for CPU consumers (thumbnail encoder).
- **Colorspace-aware conversion**: the YUV->RGB matrix is selected per frame from
  the codec's `AVFrame` colorimetry (BT.601 vs BT.709, limited vs full range) and
  built by `pj_scene2d_core/video_color.h::buildYuvMatrix`. It is a single affine
  4x4 (range scale/offset folded into the constant column), so the shader is
  unchanged across all combinations; BT.709 + full range reproduces the historical
  hardcoded matrix bit-for-bit. See §5 "Colorimetry was dropped" for the bug this
  fixed.
- Backward-compatible QImage (RGB) path kept for image viewers
- Zoom (mouse wheel) and pan (mouse drag) via view transform matrix in
  vertex shader — zero CPU-side pixel processing
- Optional zero-copy: import HW-decoded GPU surfaces directly as QRhi
  textures via `QRhiTexture::createFrom({nativeHandle, 0})`

### Shader Toolchain

The widget consumes offline-compiled Qt shader blobs (`*.qsb`) through
`QShader::fromSerialized()`. `shaders/shaders.qrc` embeds the `.qsb` files;
the neighboring `.vert` / `.frag` files are reference inputs. Editing GLSL
sources has no runtime or build effect until the matching `.qsb` file is
regenerated with Qt's `qsb` tool from the `qtshadertools` module. The W11 WASM
port bakes every pack with Qt 6.11's host tool. The overlay packs retain their
existing GLSL targets and add WebGL2:

```bash
qsb --glsl "100 es,120,150,300 es" --hlsl 50 --msl 12 \
  -o shaders/<overlay-name>.qsb shaders/<overlay-name>
```

The image pass retains its existing desktop GLSL 440 target and adds WebGL2:

```bash
qsb --glsl "300 es,440" --hlsl 50 --msl 12 \
  -o shaders/yuv_to_rgb.<stage>.qsb shaders/yuv_to_rgb.<stage>
```

Both commands retain the desktop GLSL/HLSL/MSL variants and add GLSL ES 300
for WebGL2. In an Emscripten configuration, `widgets/CMakeLists.txt` repeats that
command into the build tree and compares SHA-256 hashes with the committed
packs. Configuration therefore fails if a source and blob diverge or a pack is
rebaked with the wrong target set. A general `qt6_add_shaders` migration remains
deferred work tracked as F-009.

### QRhiWidget Multi-Instance Lifecycle (Qt 6.8)

Qt 6.8 `QRhiWidget` has a critical initialization requirement: the
top-level window's backing store must be RHI-capable from its first
`show()`. If no `QRhiWidget` exists as a child when the window is
first shown, Qt creates a regular (non-RHI) backing store. Any
`QRhiWidget` added dynamically after that point will **never** get an
RHI instance — `rhi()` returns null permanently, producing continuous
"QRhiWidget: No QRhi" errors.

**Workaround**: add a zero-size bootstrap `QRhiWidget` in the window's
constructor, before `show()`:

```cpp
// Forces Qt to create an RHI-backed backing store for this window.
auto* bootstrap = new MediaViewerWidget(parent);
bootstrap->setMaximumSize(0, 0);
layout->addWidget(bootstrap);
```

Dynamically added `QRhiWidget` instances will then initialize
successfully.

That workaround is **native-only**. Qt/WASM must not create a zero-size WebGL
surface before a browser file picker: the context can be lost during the picker
round trip, after which Emscripten's context-attribute path may dereference a
null result. The measured browser lifecycle is instead:

1. omit both the top-level and per-dock zero-size Scene2D bootstraps;
2. construct the real `MediaViewerWidget` parentless, so its constructor calls
   `setApi(OpenGL)` before `QStackedWidget` adds it to the visible hierarchy;
3. let that nonzero widget switch the top-level from raster to RHI composition;
4. after its first `frameSubmitted`, queue one full top-level repaint so the
   pre-existing raster regions are uploaded to the mixed compositor; and
5. re-arm that repaint in `releaseResources()` for a changed QRhi/top-level.

Constructing the browser viewer with its already-attached parent produced
repeated `QRhiWidget: No QRhi` and a blank dock. The parentless-before-API-fixed
ordering follows QRhiWidget's documented one-time API selection rule. A QRhi
framebuffer readback proves GPU output, while a separate full-window snapshot is
required to catch uninitialized black raster regions after the compositor switch.

### Static JPEG ABI in the monolithic WASM module

Qt's static JPEG image plugin and Scene2D's static TurboJPEG archive occupy one
WASM symbol namespace. Both export process-global `jpeg_*` symbols, so a normal
successful static link can bind a caller from one archive to the implementation
from the other. Qt 6.11's kit declares `JPEG_LIB_VERSION 80`; libjpeg-turbo's
default build emulates v6b (`62`). That mismatch crashed during splash pixmap
construction before `MainWindow`.

The WASM dependency provider therefore reads the selected Qt kit's
`QtJpeg/jconfig.h`, fails unless its ABI is the reviewed v8 contract, and builds
TurboJPEG with `WITH_JPEG8=ON`. Matching only the library versions is
insufficient here: the C ABI selected by the build option is the load-bearing
contract. Desktop continues to use its independently packaged dependencies.

**Additional lifecycle rules**:

- Override `releaseResources()` (Qt virtual) to delete all QRhi
  resources (pipeline, textures, buffers). Qt calls this when the
  underlying QRhi instance changes (reparenting, window move).
- Track `QRhi* rhi_cached_` in `initialize()`. If `rhi() != cached`,
  call `releaseResources()` and reinitialize — resources from the old
  QRhi are invalid.
- In any method that calls `update()` before the first successful `initialize()`, guard with
  `if (pipeline_ != nullptr)` — calling `update()` before init floods
  Qt with render requests that can't be fulfilled and starves the
  initialization path.
- At the end of `initialize()`, call `update()` if a frame is pending
  — otherwise the first frame set before init completes is lost.

### QVideoSink Threading

- `QVideoSink::setVideoFrame()` is thread-safe (internal `QMutex`)
- Each call replaces the previous frame (no buffering/queue)
- No built-in frame pacing — implement PTS-based timing externally
- Decode on worker thread, push to UI thread via `setVideoFrame()`

### Pixel Format Mapping

Key `AVPixelFormat` to Qt mappings (Qt handles YUV-to-RGB conversion
automatically in the renderer):

| FFmpeg `AVPixelFormat` | Qt `QVideoFrameFormat::PixelFormat` |
|---|---|
| `AV_PIX_FMT_NV12` | `Format_NV12` |
| `AV_PIX_FMT_YUV420P` | `Format_YUV420P` |
| `AV_PIX_FMT_YUV422P` | `Format_YUV422P` |
| `AV_PIX_FMT_P010` | `Format_P010` |
| `AV_PIX_FMT_RGBA` | `Format_RGBA8888` |
| `AV_PIX_FMT_BGRA` | `Format_BGRA8888` |

Keep frames in YUV420P (1.5 bytes/pixel) rather than RGBA (4 bytes/pixel) —
Qt handles conversion in the renderer.

## 2. Codec Details

### Support Matrix

| Codec | Latency | Compression vs H.264 | HW Decode Support | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| H.264/AVC | Lowest | Baseline | Universal | Primary target |
| H.265/HEVC | Low | ~40% better | Wide (GPU 2018+) | Supported |
| AV1 | Medium | ~50% better | Growing (RTX 40+, RDNA 3+) | Supported |
| VP9 | Medium | ~35% better | Moderate | Not on the streaming path |

The streaming `VideoFrame` decode path supports **h264 / h265 / av1** only.
`vp9` stays an accepted `VideoFrame.format` wire value (see `VideoFrame` in [`plotjuggler_sdk/docs/builtin_type.md`](../../plotjuggler_sdk/docs/builtin_type.md) and `pj_base/builtin/video_frame.hpp`) but has
no renderer: it has an FFmpeg decoder yet no keyframe oracle (it cannot be
sought), so `videoCodecIdFromFormat()` returns `AV_CODEC_ID_NONE` and the
decoder rejects it with an explicit "unsupported video codec" error rather than
mis-decoding. VVC/H.266 has near-zero hardware support — not targeted.

### B-Frame Support

While Foxglove and Rerun conventions recommend no B-frames, the
streaming decode path (`StreamingVideoDecoder` / `FfmpegDecoder`)
supports B-frame streams. With B-frames **decode order (DTS) differs from
presentation order (PTS)**, and the pipeline must keep the two straight:

- **The ObjectStore is keyed by DTS** (monotonic decode order — required for the
  lazy/append index). The real PTS travels in the `VideoFrame.timestamp_ns`
  payload and is surfaced to the decoder via `ExtractedFrame::pts`.
- **Feed in DTS order, serve by PTS**: `serveForward` feeds packets in store
  (DTS) order but sets `pkt->pts` to the real PTS, so `AVFrame::pts` comes back in
  presentation order. `StreamingVideoDecoder` keeps a **presentation index**
  (`pts_to_dts_`, built during the keyframe scan); `decodeAt(T)` resolves the
  frame to show as the greatest PTS ≤ T, then seeks/feeds in decode order. Serving
  is in PTS space (`ready_frames_`, `last_served_ts_`).
- Without this, B-frame video plays back in decode order — frames jitter ("vibrate")
  and the forward-continuation thrashes into per-frame GOP re-decodes (high CPU).
  With no B-frames PTS == DTS, so all of the above is the identity.
- For MCAP-stored video, I+P only (no B-frames) is still recommended
  for simpler seeking.

### Annex B NAL Units

The wire format for H.264/H.265 streaming and MCAP storage:

- Start codes: `00 00 00 01` prefix before each NAL unit
- H.264 keyframes: SPS + PPS NAL units before IDR slice (NAL type 5)
- H.265 keyframes: VPS + SPS + PPS NAL units before IRAP slice
  (NAL types 16-21)
- AV1: Sequence Header OBU before KEY_FRAME OBU (low overhead bitstream)
- Each message contains exactly enough data to decode one frame

### NAL Parser for Keyframe Detection

Required for building keyframe indices from raw bitstreams (MCAP
CompressedVideo, live streams):

- H.264: IDR detection via NAL unit type 5
- H.265: IRAP detection via NAL unit types 16-21
- Parse first byte after start code to extract NAL type
- No need to parse slice headers or reference lists — only
  keyframe/non-keyframe classification is needed

---

## 3. Hardware Acceleration

### Runtime Detection

- Detect available HW backends at runtime, not compile time
- No compile-time flags or conditional compilation for HW accel
- Probe available backends via the decode library's hardware device API

### Fallback Chains

| Platform | Chain |
|---|---|
| Linux | VAAPI → CUDA/NVDEC → software |
| Windows | D3D11VA → software |
| macOS | VideoToolbox → software |

### Device Selection

`FfmpegDecoder::open()` does not hard-code the chain above. It iterates the HW
backends the running FFmpeg was actually built with (`av_hwdevice_iterate_types`)
and keeps the first that exposes a HW decode config for the stream's codec — so
the binary's capabilities, not a static list, decide what is tried.

For **VAAPI** the device is a specific DRM render node, and the choice matters on
multi-GPU machines: `av_hwdevice_ctx_create(..., nullptr, ...)` opens the
*default* node (`/dev/dri/renderD128`), which is frequently a GPU without a VAAPI
driver (e.g. an NVIDIA dGPU on the proprietary driver) while the VAAPI-capable
GPU sits on `renderD129`. `tryHwDevice()` therefore, for VAAPI on Linux:

1. honors a `PJ_VAAPI_DEVICE=/dev/dri/renderD<N>` override (debugging/forcing);
2. otherwise walks `/dev/dri/renderD128..191` and takes the first node whose
   VAAPI driver initialises.

This walk is Linux-only (`#ifdef __linux__`) — VAAPI itself is Linux-only, and
every other backend (CUDA, D3D11VA, VideoToolbox) has no render-node concept and
uses the library default device. A backend that opens but cannot actually decode
the codec/profile degrades to software per-frame (the existing fallback), so we
deliberately do **not** pre-query `vaQueryConfigProfiles`.

### GPU Zero-Copy Path

The ideal path avoids GPU-to-CPU-to-GPU round-trips:

1. HW decoder produces frames on GPU (VAAPI surface, D3D11 texture, etc.)
2. Export as DMA-BUF (Linux) or shared texture handle (Windows/macOS)
3. Import into QRhi as `QRhiTexture` via `createFrom()`
4. Render directly — no pixel copy

Fallback: transfer GPU frames to CPU (~0.5-2ms per 1080p frame), then upload
to QRhi texture. This is acceptable for typical robotics resolutions.

---

## 4. Seeking Strategy

### File-Based Seeking

1. Build keyframe index at file open time:
   - MP4: parse `stss` (Sync Sample) atom
   - MCAP: read Summary section at EOF for O(1) access to the full message
     index; classify keyframes via NAL type inspection
   - Store as sorted vector of `{timestamp, byte_offset}`
2. Seek to nearest preceding keyframe
3. Flush decoder state (mandatory after every seek)
4. Decode forward from keyframe to target frame, discarding intermediate
   frames
5. Return the target frame

### Repaint cadence: composite at the video frame rate

`MediaViewerWidget` is a `QRhiWidget` rendered **non-natively** (inside the
widget / ADS dock hierarchy), so every repaint pays a GPU→CPU framebuffer
readback (`QRhi::endOffscreenFrame`) plus a raster composite into the window
backing store. The host advances the clock at ~60 Hz, but the picture only
changes at the video frame rate (~25–30 fps) — so repainting on every tick, half
of them on an unchanged frame, would make that compositing dominate playback CPU
(measured: this `rgb888→rgb32` composite was ~17% of the GUI thread during
large-cloud + camera playback before the gate below).

The fix lives in `pj_scene_common`: `SceneDockWidget::onTrackerTime` skips the
per-tick layer advance + `refreshView()` when the combined
`ISceneLayer::renderKey(time)` of the visible layers is unchanged.
`Scene2DLayer::renderKey` fingerprints the active sample's STAMP (a decode-free
`indexAt`/`entryTimestamps` lookup), so a static image/depth frame coalesces away
its redundant 60 Hz re-composites. Time-only overlays do not need a special case:
`ImageAnnotations` is its own `SceneDecoderLayer` with its own topic, so its stamp
enters the dock's combined key and an annotation-only change still reopens the
gate. A new base frame's async decode additionally repaints via the frame-ready
callback (`repaintRequested → refreshView`), independent of the gate. The
streaming video path (`StreamingVideoSource`) likewise surfaces a new frame only
when its worker delivers one.

### EntryThumbnailCache (streaming thumbnails)

`EntryThumbnailCache` provides instant backward scrub feedback for streaming
`VideoFrame` topics by pre-decoding keyframes into HD-capped JPEG thumbnails:

- **Background build**: a dedicated builder thread decodes ~1 keyframe per
  adaptive interval through its own per-build NAL extractor, encoding each via
  the stateless `thumbnail_codec.h`.

- **HD cap**: frames wider than 1280px (e.g., 4K/1080p) are downscaled to
  ≤1280px before caching, bounding memory while keeping enough quality for a
  scrub preview.

- **JPEG / YUV420P throughout**: thumbnails are stored as JPEG at quality 80.
  Decompression outputs YUV420P directly, so the same media shader renders both
  cached and live frames with no path mismatch. (A live frame from hardware decode
  arrives as NV12; the thumbnail encoder deinterleaves it to YUV420P first via
  `nv12ToYuv420p`, so the cached preview stays planar.)

- **Usage pattern**: during backward scrub, `StreamingVideoSource` serves the
  nearest-at-or-before thumbnail for instant feedback while the full-resolution
  GOP decode settles.

### GOP-Aware Buffer Eviction

For streaming buffers holding compressed video:

- Track GOP boundaries (keyframe positions) in the buffer
- Evict entire GOPs as a unit — never remove a keyframe while its
  dependent P-frames remain
- Eviction order: oldest GOP first
- When evicting, update the seekable time range reported to the viewer

### Memory Budget Reference

| Resolution | GOP Size (frames) | Format | Single GOP Decoded |
|---|---|---|---|
| 480p (640x480) | 30 | YUV420P | ~14 MB |
| 1080p (1920x1080) | 30 | YUV420P | ~93 MB |
| 4K (3840x2160) | 30 | YUV420P | ~372 MB |

These are decoded frame sizes. Compressed data in the buffer is typically
10-50x smaller. The LRU cache of decoded frames is what drives memory
consumption.

## 5. Implementation Insights

Lessons from the standalone pj_scene2D experiment and the mcap_player prototype
(both since removed; retained here as architectural rationale).

### Colorimetry was dropped (the BT.709 full-range hardcode)

For a long time `avFrameToDecodedFrame` discarded `AVFrame::colorspace` and
`AVFrame::color_range`, and the media shader applied a hardcoded **full-range
BT.709** matrix to every YUV frame. Two latent correctness bugs followed:

- **Wrong matrix for SD content.** BT.601 (SMPTE 170M / BT.470BG) luma coefficients
  differ from BT.709; applying 709 to 601 content shifts saturated hues.
- **Wrong range for limited-range video.** Most camera/file H.264/HEVC is *limited*
  range (luma 16..235); a full-range matrix renders it with raised blacks and
  clipped/greyed whites (washed out).

The metadata was always there in the `AVFrame` we already decode — it was just
thrown away. Fix: carry `YuvColorSpace` / `YuvColorRange` on `DecodedFrame` (mapped
from the `AVFrame`, with the standard SD-height→601 and unspecified-range→limited
fallbacks) and build the matrix per frame with `video_color.h::buildYuvMatrix`.

Key implementation choice: encode the whole thing as **one affine 4x4** applied to
`vec4(y, u-0.5, v-0.5, 1)`, with the limited-range luma scale (255/219), chroma
scale (255/224) and all offsets folded into the constant 4th column. That keeps the
GLSL untouched (no `.qsb` recompile was needed for that fix), and makes
BT.709+full reduce to the exact historical matrix so existing full-range content
is byte-identical. Unit-tested in `video_color_test` (black/white/gray
reconstruction + 601≠709). The later W11 WebGL2 re-bake changes only the packed
target dialects, not this shader math.

Corollary — **HW decode now emits NV12, not YUV420P.** Once `FfmpegDecoder` stopped
forcing `sws_scale` to YUV420P, VAAPI frames come back as `kNV12`. Any consumer of
decoder output must handle NV12: the GPU upload (native two-plane), the pixel
inspector (`pixelRgbAt` already had an NV12 case), and the thumbnail encoder (which
deinterleaves via `nv12ToYuv420p`). Tests that decode real video must accept either
`kYUV420P` (software) or `kNV12` (hardware).

### Timestamp Unit Conversion

FFmpeg internally uses stream `time_base` (e.g., 1/90000 for MPEG-TS,
1/1000 for MKV), not nanoseconds. pj_scene2D uses nanoseconds consistently
(matching pj_datastore). Conversion must happen at the codec interface using
`av_rescale_q(pts, stream_time_base, {1, 1'000'000'000})` for numerically
accurate results. Avoid manual multiplication — it loses precision for
non-power-of-two time bases.

### Seeking Requires Decoding Forward

After seeking to the nearest keyframe before the target timestamp, the
decoder must decode forward — discarding all intermediate frames — until it
reaches the target. For a GOP of 30 frames this means up to 29 wasted
decodes. For long GOPs (250+ frames) this can take hundreds of milliseconds.

This is why short GOPs matter for interactive scrubbing. Foxglove recommends
keyframes every ~1 second. LeRobot uses GOP=2 (keyframe every 2 frames),
achieving near-random-access with significant compression.

### Clock-Based Playback Scheduling

For smooth file playback, the display timer maintains a playback clock:

- On play: record `wall_start = steady_clock::now()` and `pts_start`
- Each tick: `expected_pts = pts_start + (now - wall_start)`
- Present the frame whose PTS is nearest-before `expected_pts`

Live mode skips the clock entirely — always show the latest frame, drop
older ones. This is the fundamental behavioral split between file and
streaming playback.

### StreamingVideoDecoder: Lessons Learned

**Keyframe index must track by timestamp, not count.** During steady-state
streaming with retention, `ObjectStore::entryCount()` stays constant
(push+evict). A count-based scan cursor (`if (count > last_scanned) scan`)
silently stops indexing new keyframes. Track by timestamp instead:
`indexAt(last_scanned_ts_) + 1` finds new entries regardless of count.

**Same-timestamp caching is critical.** When the display polls at 60 Hz
but frames arrive at 30 Hz, every other `decodeAt()` call requests the
same timestamp. Without caching, this triggers a full keyframe→target
seek+decode. For 1920p video with large GOPs, this causes visible
stuttering. Solution: cache `last_frame_` and return it immediately when
`target_ts == last_decoded_ts_`.

**Forward decode must survive keyframe eviction.** In live mode, the
original keyframe gets evicted while the decoder continues forward.
The decoder state is still valid — it just needs new packets. The forward
path must not require the keyframe index (`keyframe_timestamps_` may be
empty) or the original keyframe entry (may be evicted). Only backward
seeks require a keyframe still in the store.

**Parameter sets are primed before opening H.264/HEVC streams.**
The streaming decoder builds `AVCodecParameters` with
`makeVideoCodecParams(codec_id)` and primes H.264/HEVC extradata from the first
keyframe via `primeKeyframeParamSets()` before opening `FfmpegDecoder`. This
matches demuxer-provided codec config and avoids the observed first-B-frame drop
when H.264 parameter sets are consumed only in-band. `h264_utils.h` now keeps
only the H.264 keyframe oracle; codec-parameter construction and parameter-set
extraction live in `video_codec_utils`.

**Never drain() during live streaming startup.** FFmpeg's `avcodec_send_packet(nullptr)`
signals EOF and puts the codec in drain state. Subsequent `avcodec_send_packet` calls
return `AVERROR_EOF` until `avcodec_flush_buffers` is called. With B-frames, the
decoder returns EAGAIN for the first ~30 packets (reorder buffer filling). If you
drain after each failed decode, you poison the codec state, forcing a full
flush+re-decode-from-keyframe on every call — O(n^2) total. Fix: treat EAGAIN as
normal, update `last_decoded_ts_` to track position, and let the forward path feed
more packets on subsequent calls.

**DTS-keyed ObjectStore storage for B-frame videos.** When ingesting from MP4
containers with B-frames, use DTS (always monotonic) as the ObjectStore
timestamp, not PTS (non-monotonic). FFmpeg's decoder expects packets in decode
order and handles reordering internally — `AVFrame::pts` on the output gives
the correct presentation timestamp. For production streaming (per VideoFrame
spec), B-frames are disallowed, so PTS == DTS and this is a non-issue.

**ObjectStore indices shift after eviction.** A cached `last_decoded_index_`
becomes stale after eviction removes entries from the front. Always
re-derive the index via `indexAt(last_decoded_ts_)` instead of caching it.

### Zoom and Pan via GPU Transform

With QRhiWidget rendering, zoom and pan require only a view transform matrix
in the vertex shader (scale + translate). No pixel reprocessing.

Cursor-anchored zoom (keeps the point under the cursor fixed):
```
pan += cursor_pos * (1/new_zoom - 1/old_zoom)
```

When zoom <= 1.0, reset pan to zero (video fits entirely in widget).

## 6. Streaming Protocols

### Latency Characteristics

| Protocol | Typical Latency | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Raw TCP/UDP | <50ms | No error recovery |
| SRT | 120-500ms (tunable) | Best balance for robotics |
| WebRTC/WHEP | 200-500ms | Complex setup, feature-rich |
| RTSP | 1-3s | Surveillance cameras, widely supported |
| RTMP | 1-3s | Legacy ingest |
| HLS/DASH | 2-6s | Too high for interactive robotics |

### SRT as Primary Live Protocol

SRT (Secure Reliable Transport) offers the best balance for robot-to-desktop:

- Latency tunable via `SRTO_LATENCY` socket option
- ARQ retransmission for reliability over lossy networks
- Payload: raw H.264 Annex B NAL units
- Available on Conan (`srt/1.5.4`)

### ROS 2 Image Topics

`sensor_msgs/Image` and `sensor_msgs/CompressedImage` arrive as individual
messages, each independently displayable. No inter-frame dependencies.
Timestamps are in the message header (nanoseconds).

`foxglove.CompressedVideo` messages in MCAP carry one video frame each with
nanosecond timestamps, using Annex B encoding.

## 7. Storage-Mode / Handle Resolution by Backend

How the ObjectStore owning-handle storage model (REQUIREMENTS.md §4.2
"Storage Integration") maps to concrete backends. §4.2 abstracts the two
internal storage modes — owned bytes (streaming) vs lazy fetch callbacks
(file-backed) — behind a uniform owning handle; the per-backend
Stored/Resolve strategies below are the concrete realizations of those
modes.

### MCAP Handle

- Stored: file handle + message index entry (chunk offset + message offset)
- Resolve: seek to chunk, decompress if needed, read message bytes, parse
  according to schema (Image or VideoFrame)
- For VideoFrame: find nearest preceding keyframe in the index, decode
  forward
- MCAP Summary section provides O(1) access to the full index without
  scanning the data section

### LeRobot MP4 Handle

- Stored: MP4 file path + presentation timestamp (PTS)
- Resolve: open MP4, seek to nearest keyframe before PTS, decode forward to
  target PTS
- Timestamp mapping: Parquet `timestamp` column provides nanosecond
  timestamps; PTS provides the seek target within the MP4
- One MP4 file per camera per episode (v2) or per chunk (v3)

### RLDS TFRecord Handle

- Stored: TFRecord shard file path + record byte offset
- Resolve: seek to offset, read record, extract image tensor from
  FeaturesDict
- Images are stored as raw tensors `(H, W, 3) uint8` — no video codec
  decoding needed
- No inter-frame dependencies; every record is self-contained

### Live Buffer Handle

- Stored: buffer pointer + byte range within the ring buffer
- Resolve: read compressed bytes from the range, decode
- For video: the byte range covers a single encoded frame; the decoder must
  have been initialized from the preceding keyframe
- Handle is valid only while the buffer has not evicted the referenced data;
  the frame store must handle invalidation gracefully

## 9. Resolved Design Questions

These questions were identified early and resolved during architecture design.

### MessageParser Extension vs New Plugin Family

**Resolved:** Keep MessageParser stateless. Parsers are codec-agnostic
envelope peelers (CDR, Protobuf, JSON). All video decoder state lives in
pj_scene2D's decoder classes (`FfmpegDecoder`, `StreamingVideoDecoder`),
never in any plugin. See ARCHITECTURE.md §4 and REQUIREMENTS.md §4.4.

### Mixed Scalar + Media Output from a Single Parse Call

**Resolved (delivered as `pj_plugins` MessageParser protocol v4).** The
originally-proposed parser ABI v2 / two-host `parse()` signature was
superseded by a service-registry model. The `parse()` slot takes only
`(ctx, timestamp_ns, payload, out_error)` — no host parameters. Instead, a
parser acquires its write hosts at `bind(registry)` time via named
services: a scalar write host (`pj.parser_write.v1`) and, for media, an
object write host (`pj.parser_object_write.v1`). It then writes scalar and
media portions to the bound hosts inside a single `parse()` call. This is
no longer an outstanding prerequisite — `PJ_MESSAGE_PARSER_PROTOCOL_VERSION`
is 4. See REQUIREMENTS.md Prerequisites and ARCHITECTURE.md §2/§4.

### Metadata Availability: Eager vs Lazy

**Resolved:** Initialize the decoder eagerly on the first keyframe (one open per
channel, not per frame). `StreamingVideoDecoder` opens from the `codec_id`
resolved from `VideoFrame.format` (`makeVideoCodecParams`) and primes
`extradata` from that keyframe's in-band parameter sets via
`primeKeyframeParamSets` (deduplicated against the in-band copies — duplicated
sets would reproduce the first-B-frame drop the priming exists to fix). No lazy
metadata deferral.

---

## 10. MediaSource Pattern

The `MediaSource` interface is the uniform frame-delivery contract
between decoder backends and `MediaViewerWidget`. It replaces the
originally-planned `PlaybackController` (which would have been a
monolithic orchestrator conflicting with the streaming decode path's
self-contained threading).

**Interface:**
```cpp
class MediaSource {
 public:
  virtual ~MediaSource() = default;
  virtual void setTimestamp(int64_t ts_ns) = 0;
  virtual std::optional<MediaFrame> takeFrame() = 0;
};
```

**Key properties:**
- `setTimestamp()` is called by the main thread when the global time
  changes. Image, streaming-video, and depth sources post to an internal
  worker thread; the scene source decodes synchronously on the caller thread.
- `takeFrame()` is called by the main thread at render rate. Returns
  the latest `MediaFrame` (base pixels and/or overlays), or nullopt if
  nothing new since the last call.
- No `cancel()` in the public interface — each implementation manages
  cancellation internally.
- The widget calls `update()` after `setTimestamp()` to trigger a repaint.

**Concrete implementations** (all in `pj_scene2d_core`):
- `ImagePipelineSource` — worker-backed image decode via `CodecPipeline`
  + `ObjectStore`; latest decoded result is polled by `takeFrame()`.
- `DepthPipelineSource` — worker-backed depth decode (R32F + GPU colormap
  params; the compressedDepth PNG inflate runs off the UI thread); latest
  result polled by `takeFrame()`.
- `ScenePipelineSource` — synchronous scene/annotation decode in
  `setTimestamp()`.
- `StreamingVideoSource` — worker-backed `StreamingVideoDecoder`; latest-wins
  request/result handoff.
- `CompositeMediaSource` — fans `setTimestamp`/`takeFrame` out across N
  child sources (multi-layer).
- `BorrowedMediaSource` — non-owning adapter over an externally-owned
  source.

## 11. Lessons Learned (Code Review Fixes)

Bugs found during a 4-agent parallel code review (API design, silent
failures, type design, Codex) and fixed via TDD.

**YUV420P chroma plane sizing must use ceiling division.** For
YUV420P, chroma planes are `ceil(w/2) x ceil(h/2)`, not `w/2 x h/2`.
Truncating integer division causes buffer overflow on odd-dimension
video (e.g. 1921x1081). Fixed by adding `expectedBufferSize()` to
`decoded_frame.h` — a single source of truth for all YUV/NV12 buffer
size calculations. Every allocation site must use this function.

**`avFrameToDecodedFrame` must propagate errors, not return null
frames as success.** When HW transfer or sws_getContext fails,
returning `DecodedFrame{}` wraps a null frame in `Expected<T>` as a
"success" — callers have no way to distinguish it from a real frame.
Changed return type to `Expected<DecodedFrame>` with error strings.

**MCAP's `schemas()` and `channels()` return by value.** Calling
`reader.schemas().find(id)` creates an iterator into a temporary map
that is destroyed at the semicolon. Classic dangling iterator UB —
heap-use-after-free under ASAN. Fix: cache the map in a local variable
before iterating.

**Codec stages must validate input format and buffer size.** Pipeline
stages like `SegmentationPalette` and `Mono16ToGrayscale` compute read
lengths from `width*height` but never check `pixels->size()`. With
malformed input, this is an out-of-bounds read.

**RTLD_DEEPBIND is incompatible with AddressSanitizer.** `dlopen` with
`RTLD_DEEPBIND` conflicts with ASAN's runtime interceptors. Fixed by
defining `PJ_ASAN_ACTIVE` when sanitizers are enabled and skipping
the flag in that case.

## 12. Camera Rectification (2D annotation alignment)

`ImagePipelineSource::rectifyIfCalibrated` (using `undistort_remap` +
`image_rectifier`) exists to fix one specific symptom: 2D `ImageAnnotations`
(YOLO boxes, masks, keypoints) rendering **misaligned** over the camera image
in datasets like Waymo.

### The problem it solves

The misalignment is a **coordinate-space mismatch**, not a projection issue.
2D detections are pixel coordinates — they need no geometric transform to draw.
But in Waymo/Foxglove the annotations are authored in the camera's **native,
rectified (lens-undistorted)** space (e.g. 1920×886), while PJ4 was displaying
the **raw, distorted, subsampled** image (e.g. 480×221). Two mismatches stack:
resolution (coords out of scale) and lens distortion (boxes drift, worst at the
edges). A scale-only fix handles the first but not the second; full rectification
(`K, D, R, P`) handles both, lifting the image into the annotations' space so the
boxes land without touching a single detection coordinate.

`frame_id` on `sdk::Image` is what pairs an image with its `CameraInfo` (each
`<ns>/camera_info` topic is parsed and injected via `setCameraInfoMap`). The
producer side (parser_protobuf / parser_ros) populates it.

### Design choice: rectify the image, not warp the annotations

Two ways to reconcile the spaces: (A) rectify the image to the annotation space,
or (B) keep the raw image and distort every annotation vertex into raw space. We
chose **A** — it matches Foxglove Studio, shows the undistorted image the detector
actually "saw", and avoids applying the inverse map to every polygon/mask point.

### GPU vs CPU rectification (where it runs)

*Whether* to rectify is unchanged (the assumption below); *where* it runs is now
chosen at runtime, because the float CPU resample was ~63–68% of process CPU
(profiled) across the per-camera decode worker threads.

- **GPU path (default when available).** The decode worker leaves the frame RAW
  and attaches the cached `shared_ptr<const UndistortMap>` to
  `DecodedFrame::rectify_map`. `MediaViewerWidget` rectifies in the image
  fragment shader via an `RGBA32F` remap LUT (`undistortMapToNormalizedRG`,
  NEAREST, +0.5 half-texel) — one extra texture lookup per pixel, and the upload
  shrinks to the raw frame size. Works for YUV420P too (the shader remaps the UV,
  then samples the planes).
- **CPU fallback** (`rectifyFrameFast` + `UndistortMapFast`): a precomputed
  source index + fixed-point bilinear fractions resampled into a reused buffer —
  **bit-for-bit equal** to the float `rectifyFrame` (a unit test asserts zero
  mismatches) and ~2× faster (34.1 → 16.6 ms/frame at 1920×1280 RGB). Used when
  the backend can't sample an `RGBA32F` LUT.
- **Selection.** A one-time capability handshake
  (`MediaSource::setGpuRectificationAvailable`, probed by the widget in
  `initialize()`, fanned out through `Composite`/`BorrowedMediaSource`) flips the
  mode; the default is the CPU-correct path until the widget confirms GPU support,
  and a flip calls `invalidate()` to re-decode. Both paths produce the identical
  displayed image at native calibration resolution, so the annotation /
  aspect / pixel-inspector contract holds regardless of path (see
  ARCHITECTURE §7.2 for the logical-size decouple).

### ASSUMPTION and its known blind spot

The decision rule is *"a usable `CameraInfo` exists for this image's `frame_id` ⟹
rectify to native resolution."* That encodes an **assumption**: that the image is
still in raw sensor space and the annotations live in native rectified space. True
for Waymo / Foxglove / the ROS `image_proc` convention (detectors run on
`image_rect`), but **not universal**, because:

- **`CameraInfo` describes the lens, not the current image state.** The *same*
  `CameraInfo` (same `K`/`D`/`frame_id`) accompanies both `/image_raw` and
  `/image_rect`. Its presence does not tell us whether the pixels we're showing
  are still distorted. So `isRectifiable()` is a *capability* check ("has usable
  intrinsics"), **not** a "this image needs rectifying" decision.
- **Failure mode 1 — double rectification:** a producer that logs a pre-rectified
  image alongside its `CameraInfo` (`D ≠ 0`) gets undistorted a second time → the
  image warps the wrong way, annotations drift.
- **Failure mode 2 — raw-space detections:** if detections were computed on the
  raw image (and thus already align with it), rectifying the image alone moves the
  pixels but not the boxes → misalignment of a pair that was fine.

The safe default still holds: **no `CameraInfo` / empty intrinsics / no `frame_id`
→ raw passthrough, annotations overlay directly.** Other gaps: on the CPU path,
planar / 16-bit pixel formats pass through unrectified (`rectifyFrameFast` /
`rectifyFrame` return false / `nullopt`) — the GPU path does rectify YUV420P; a
`CameraInfo` published *after* the layer attaches is not retro-applied.

The first escape hatch for the blind spot now ships: a per-layer **"Rectify"**
toggle on `ImageLayer` (a `PJ::ToggleSwitch`, default on). It gates the
auto-decision via `ImagePipelineSource::setRectifyEnabled(false)`, which short-
circuits `rectifyIfCalibrated` to raw passthrough — the operator's manual override
for a stream that's already rectified (failure mode 1) or whose detections live in
raw space (failure mode 2). The flag is persisted in the layout XML
(`rectify_enabled`); an absent attribute (older layout) keeps the default-on
behaviour. It is an explicit user choice, not a smarter automatic rule.

### If we ever need an automatic decision

The toggle puts the choice in the operator's hands; a future version could *also*
decide automatically when no human is in the loop. Key the decision on something
more explicit than "calibration exists": compare the annotation's reference
`frameSize` against the displayed image, gate on the topic name (`*_raw*` vs
`*_rect*`), or skip when `D` is effectively zero. Out of scope today; documented
here so the assumption stays a deliberate, visible choice.

## 13. Depth-aware Point Inspector

The hover Point Inspector (`pixel_inspector.{h,cpp}`, driven by
`MediaViewerWidget::refreshPointInspector`) is **format-aware**. For ordinary
images it shows the zoom grid + RGB readout. For a depth frame
(`PixelFormat::kDepthR32F`) the "RGB" is meaningless: depth pixels store **metric
depth in metres**, and the colour you see is produced on the GPU by the colormap
shader (the LUT), not stored per-pixel. So the inspector specializes:

- **Sample the right quantity.** `depthMetersAt(frame, x, y)` reads the float32
  depth. No-data is `!isfinite(v) || v <= 0` — the *same* rule
  `DepthPipelineSource` uses and the shader's `!(d > 0)` test applies, so the
  readout's "— (no data)" agrees pixel-for-pixel with the transparent pixels on
  screen. (Invalid depths are already collapsed to `0.0f` in the frame buffer.)
- **Reproduce the on-screen colour for the swatch.** `depthColormapColor(depth,
  params)` mirrors the shader exactly: `t = clamp((d - near) / max(far - near,
  1e-6), 0, 1)`, optional invert, then `pj_widgets::colorFor(colormap, t)` — the
  same function the GPU LUT is *built* from, so the swatch matches the display up
  to the LUT's 256-entry quantization. A regression test (`pixel_inspector_test`,
  `PixelInspectorDepth.*`) pins the swatch to `colorFor` so it can't silently
  drift if the colormap math changes.
- **Drop the zoom grid.** Magnifying a colormapped pixel adds nothing; depth mode
  shows only `Position`, the metric `Depth`, and the swatch. The tooltip sizes its
  width with `QFontMetrics` so the longer "— (no data)" line isn't clipped.

Unlike the RGB path (which hides on an off-image / empty crop), depth mode still
shows the tooltip on a no-data pixel — position + "no data" is useful information.
Mono8/Mono16 keep their grayscale RGB readout: there the channel value *is* the
meaningful quantity.
