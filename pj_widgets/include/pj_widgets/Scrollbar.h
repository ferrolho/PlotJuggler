///   - Placement::kOverlayViewport — the native bar policy is forced to
///     ScrollBarAlwaysOff (the bar remains live as the scroll-state source of
///     truth; only its visual widget is hidden) and this widget floats over the
///     edge strip of the viewport. Content reflows under the strip, so the pill
///     can cover it — acceptable only when the host owns the viewport and keeps
///     that strip free of interactive content (the Timeline).
///   - Placement::kReservedGutter — the native bar keeps its authored policy
///     and its layout slot (content never flows under the pill), but is painted
///     blank; this widget covers the bar's rect and mirrors its style-resolved
///     handle. All presses/drags/paging go to the native bar itself — in this
///     mode the pill never consumes a mouse event, so it cannot steal a content
///     click. The default for areas adapted by attachPillScrollbars().
///
/// Common to both placements:
///   - This widget re-parents itself to the area and repaints whenever the
///     native bar's value or range changes.
///   - A QGraphicsOpacityEffect fades the pill in/out; the pill is hidden
///     (opacity 0) by default and revealed when the cursor enters the edge
///     strip / gutter (auto-hide mode). setAutoHide(false) pins it visible.
///   - Scrolling the viewport (mouse wheel or trackpad scroll gesture) also
///     briefly reveals the matching-axis pill even when the cursor is nowhere
///     near the strip; it fades out kScrollRevealHoldMs after the last scroll
///     unless the cursor is then hovering the strip.
///
/// Overlay-mode drag-to-scroll: a left-press on the handle grabs the pill
/// (with setClickToScroll(true), anywhere in the strip). Events during an
/// active drag are consumed (return true) so the underlying view is not
