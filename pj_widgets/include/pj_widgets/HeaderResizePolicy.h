/**
 * Splitter-style column resizing for any QHeaderView.
 *
 * Qt's stock header grows the whole header when a divider is dragged, which
 * either strands dead space to the right of the last column or pushes the table
 * into a horizontal scrollbar. The usual workaround — marking one column
 * `Stretch` — is worse: a `Stretch` section silently absorbs the entire delta,
 * so the divider under the cursor does not move at all and the boundary to its
 * *left* slides instead, and the divider adjacent to the stretched section
 * cannot be dragged at all.
 *
 * This policy makes a header behave like a QSplitter: the dragged divider
 * follows the cursor, the immediately following column gives or takes exactly
 * that much width, no other column moves, and the sections always sum to the
 * header's width. Every section stays `Interactive`, so every divider is live.
 *
 * One section is nominated as the *fill* section (the wide "name" column by
 * convention). It absorbs the slack whenever the header itself is resized or a
 * column is shown/hidden, which keeps the table exactly viewport-wide without
 * making the section non-interactive.
 *
 * Install once per header; a second install on the same header is a no-op. The
 * policy owns itself as a child of the header and dies with it.
