/**
 * Lights a table header's column divider while it is grabbable, matching the
 * way a QSplitter handle reacts: the Highlight variant's Hovered colour under
 * the cursor, its Pressed colour while being dragged.
 *
 * This cannot be a stylesheet rule. `QHeaderView::section:hover` fires when the
 * pointer is anywhere over a section, not over its ~4-px resize grip, and QSS
 * has no selector for "this section is currently being resized" at all. So the
 * highlight is a thin overlay widget positioned over the gripped boundary.
 *
 * Only boundaries that actually resize are lit: the last section's right edge
 * is skipped, because there is no following column to trade width with (see
 * HeaderResizePolicy) and highlighting it would advertise a drag that does
 * nothing.
 *
 * Install once per header; a second install on the same header is a no-op. The
 * object parents itself to the header and dies with it.
