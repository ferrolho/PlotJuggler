// Headless per-batch owner of ONE descriptor-import provider toolbox
// instance — MainWindow::launchToolbox minus the UI half (no dialog, no
// PanelEngine, no QWidget). LayoutImportBatch (T6) owns exactly one of
// these per import batch and is this class's sole intended consumer.
//
// create() finds the provider toolbox by its STABLE MANIFEST ID in the
// plugin catalog, assembles the SAME host-service set the interactive path
// binds (ToolboxRuntimeHost + DataProcessorsRuntimeHost + the per-instance
// SourcePromotionHost, all registered strictly before bind()), creates and
// binds one plugin instance, and resolves its "pj.descriptor_import.v1"
// extension — so a provider plugin sees an IDENTICAL host environment
// headless vs interactive. No loadConfig() is issued: an import session's
// inputs arrive via the descriptor, and the plugin reads its own persisted
// settings (server history, credentials) through the SettingsStoreService
// that ToolboxRuntimeHost::registerServices already provides. Creation FAILS
// cleanly (an error Expected with a precise reason, no leaked handle) when
// the manifest id is unknown, bind() fails, the extension is absent, or the
// extension's struct_size does not cover the v1 slots. The §6.4
// provider-absent stock fallback is the CALLER's job — this class only
// reports the reason.
//
// Holding the session pins the plugin DSO: the ToolboxHandle's internal
// library owner keeps the shared library loaded even across catalog
// rescans, satisfying the SDK rule that the plugin instance and its DSO
// stay alive until every JoinableJob obtained through the extension view
// has been destroyed (the view itself holds no keep-alive).
//
// Threading: the session is a QObject that must be created and destroyed on
// the GUI thread; create()/queryDescriptor()/startImport()/cancelJob()/
// cancelAll()/joinAll() are GUI-thread-only ([main-thread] slots on the
// provider side, and the job registry is deliberately unsynchronized). Both
// startImport callbacks are marshalled QUEUED-ONLY onto the GUI thread —
// provider job-callback threads only post, never run host code (the
// project-wide marshal rule shared with the promotion/runtime-host
// callbacks).
//
// QUIESCENCE GUARANTEE (the absorbed PR-A follow-up): the concurrent
// dtor-vs-worker race on ToolboxRuntimeHost is out of contract — the plugin
// must be unbound and its workers quiesced before host destruction
// (ToolboxRuntimeHost.h). This session is the layer that MAKES that
// precondition true. Its destructor, in order:
//   (1) cancels, joins, and destroys EVERY import job (so no provider
//       worker can ever call back into the hosts again);
//   (2) destroys the SourcePromotionHost (its dtor fails pending promotion
//       callbacks, which reaches plugin code — the instance/DSO must still
//       be alive);
//   (3) releases the plugin handle (instance destroy, DSO unpin);
//   (4) tears down builder, dp-host, runtime host, settings — the same
//       relative order as MainWindow's ~PanelSession.
// Teardown consequence of the queued-only marshal: a queued-but-undelivered
// terminal metacall is purged by ~QObject. That is legal ONLY because step
// (1) already cancelled+joined those jobs, so the owner has concluded them
// as cancelled before the notification could have been observed.
//
// Not movable: host vtables and the queued metacalls store `this`.
