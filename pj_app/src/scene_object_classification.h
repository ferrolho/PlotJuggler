// kDepthImage), video (kVideoFrame), and image annotations. Used for the curve-
// list "2D-viewable" icon and for placeholder-drop routing.
//
// A depth-encoded kImage is ALSO hostable in 3D (DepthCloud), but the depth-vs-
// color split is an `encoding` (payload) distinction, not a type one — so it is
// resolved by the consumer (the dock peeking a sample), never here. Because this
// predicate cannot tell depth from color, placeholder-drop routing treats the
// whole family as 2D-first; depth→3D is an explicit action (drop onto an
// existing 3D dock, or "Open in 3D view").

// The drop-routing decision, in one place: the object-dock kind ("scene2d" /
// "scene3d") a catalog drop of `type` resolves to, or empty when no compiled
// family accepts it. Image-family types route 2D-first and never fall back to
// 3D (a color image must not land in a 3D dock that would reject it; depth→3D
// stays an explicit action); kSceneEntities is claimed by both families and 3D
// wins. MainWindow's object-dock factory consumes this directly.

// True when a drop of `type` resolves to a dock that accepts it — so the curve
// list never offers a drag that could only end in the "cannot display"
// fallback. Types outside every claim (kCameraInfo, kOccupancyGridUpdate, ...)
// are consumed indirectly or have no viewer yet.
